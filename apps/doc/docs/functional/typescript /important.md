### never

[](https://www.zhenghao.io/posts/ts-never)

To fully understand never type and its purposes, we must first understand what a type is, and what role it plays in a type system.

A type is a set of possible values. For example, string type represents an infinite set of possible strings.

Since thereâ€™s no values in the set, never type can never (pun-intended) have any value, including values of any type.

The fulfilled value's type of a rejected promise
const p = Promise.reject('foo') //  p: Promise< never >

### Interfaces vs. Type Aliases

As we mentioned, type aliases can act sort of like interfaces; however, there are some subtle differences.

Almost all features of an interface are available in type, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.

### Indexed Access Types

```typescript
function prop<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {
  return obj[key];
}
```

TypeScript now infers the prop function to have a return type of T[K], a so-called indexed access type or lookup type. It represents the type of the property K of the type T. If we now access the three todo properties via the prop method, each one will have the correct type:

For another real-world example, check out how the Object.entries() method is typed in the lib.es2017.object.d.ts type declaration file that ships with the TypeScript compiler:

```typescript
interface ObjectConstructor {
  // ...
  entries<T extends { [key: string]: any }, K extends keyof T>(
    o: T,
  ): [keyof T, T[K]][];
  // ...
}
```
